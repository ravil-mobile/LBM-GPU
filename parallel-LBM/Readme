It is a 2D implementation of the Lattice Boltzmann Method in CUDA.

Installation:
	mkdir build
	cd ./build
	cmake ..
	make

To run an example (from the "build folder"):
	./lbm -p ../data/params.txt -m ../data/mesh.txt -b ../data/boundary.txt -t ../data/theads_distr.txt

To generate a mesh file, you can use any black & white image. You can use "mesh_generator.py" script
to convert your image to a mesh. You can find the script in the "utils" folder.
	Example:
		cd ./utils
		python ./mesh_generator.py ./mesh-1.jpg
		# the script generates "mesh.txt" file which contains the corresponding mesh
		cp ./mesh.txt ../data/

Please, be sure that you have cuda-8 installed together with the corresponding video driver
(nvidia-384 or nvidia-390) and "glew" library.	You can refer to the following link: 
http://glew.sourceforge.net/install.html, to read more about "glew" library.
